# MyWebClass collaboration and brainstorming activity to identify required content for mywebclass
## Instructions
Each person should fork this repository to their own account.  Once you fork it to your own account, you should enable "issues" in the repository settings, if you don't see the issues tab in the main menu.  Go to the issues tab and click miletones to add a 0.1.0 milestone and describe it as a consolodated list of issues from your team.  Then go to the project board and create one task for every item in your list in the todo column. Once you have all your tasks then pick the top task and assign it to yourself, assign it to a milestone 0.1.0, click open in new tab to go to the issue page and create a branch for it.   Once its all set and your ready to work on it move it to the in progress column.  

Once you have a branch then you will need to clone the rep and type git fetch to see any new branches and then checkout the issue branch of the issue that you will work on.  Once you add your issue to the readme.md file, you should push the branch back to github and make a pull request.  In the message when you go to merge the pull request, you need to type "closes #<insert your issue number>" example: "closes #1" and then after you merge the pull request it will move your task card for that issue from in progress to done.  By this time your partner should have completed this as well and you or your partner can make a pull request to merge their feature into the owners repository.  Only the owner of the repository can actually merge.  You may get merge conflicts; however, you can reduce the likelihood of a conflict by  making sure that both partners' repo's master  branch is updated and that the branch you are submitting a pull request for is uptodate with master on both repositories.
